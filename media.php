the only drug I need<br>\
when I feel DOWN AND OUT!</p>\

or when they all are gone<br>\
together with my best friends<br>\
or when I am alone</p>\
<p>when the good waves are coming<br>\
or when they all are gone<br>\
my heart beats for my lover<br>\
my heart beats for my board</p>\
<p>FOR MY BOARD!</p>\

a few land owners ruled the poorest lands of Andalusia<br>\
They had the money, they had big fortunes<br>\
but they never could conquer the heart of those working men</p>\
<p>Take me back to thirty-three I want to join the anarchists<br>\
women and men against the State<br>\
fighting for freedom, for liberty</p>\
<p>Take me back where men can dream, I want to feel what freedom is<br>\
mutual support, just truth and love<br>\
together fighting for a better world!</p>\
<p>A better world!</p>\
<p>Poverty, hunger, desperation and disease<br>\
do you still believe what books say about democracy?<br>\
Those men and women showed the world how to live<br>\
without a flag, without religion, without a church.</p>\
<p>NO FLAG, NO NATIONS, FIGHT BACK THE OPPRESSION</p>\
<p>A better world without flags<br>\
a better world for all</p>\
<p>Warriors without a nation<br>\
die standing tall and free</p>\
<span style='text-align:left'><p><b>Fight for a better world!</b></p>\
<i><p>Andalusia was (and still is) a very underrated land oppressed by many nations through History.<br>\
We want to tribute all those women and men from our land who stood up against injustice represented by landlords,<br>\
bourgeoisies, flags, religion and economic power.<br>\
Our land, the poorest area from the Spanish State,<br>\
had and important anarchist revolution in 1933 where many rural workers and farmers proclaimed a free-communist<br>\
society before they were murdered by the Spanish guard. This song is dedicated to all these women and men,<br>\
this is our token of respect and our attempt to recall an important chapter in the Andalusian History.</i></span><br>\
